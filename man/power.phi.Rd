\arguments{
\item{alpha}{- type-I error rate.}

\item{n}{- dimension parameter, i.e. the number of input statitics to construct phi-divergence statistic.}

\item{s}{- phi-divergence parameter. s = 2 is the higher criticism statitic.s = 1 is the Berk and Jones statistic.}

\item{beta}{- search range parameter. Search range = (1, beta*n). Beta must be between 1/n and 1.}

\item{method}{- different alternative hypothesis, including mixtures such as, "gaussian-gaussian", "gaussian-t", "t-t", "chisq-chisq", and "exp-chisq". By default, we use Gaussian mixture.}

\item{eps}{- mixing parameter of the mixture.}

\item{mu}{- mean of non standard Gaussian model.}

\item{df}{- degree of freedom of t/Chisq distribution and exp distribution.}

\item{delta}{- non-cenrality of t/Chisq distribution.}

\description{
Statistical power of phi-divergence test.

\details{
We consider the following hypothesis test,
\deqn{H_0: X_i\sim F, H_a: X_i\sim G}
Specifically, \eqn{F = F_0} and \eqn{G = (1-\epsilon)F_0+\epsilon F_1}, where \eqn{\epsilon} is the mixing parameter, \eqn{F_0} and \eqn{F_1} is
speified by the "method" argument:

"gaussian-gaussian": \eqn{F_0} is the standard normal CDF and \eqn{F = F_1} is the CDF of normal distribution with \eqn{\mu} defined by mu and \eqn{\sigma = 1}.

"gaussian-t": \eqn{F_0} is the standard normal CDF and \eqn{F = F_1} is the CDF of t distribution with degree of freedom defined by df.

"t-t": \eqn{F_0} is the CDF of t distribution with degree of freedom defined by df and \eqn{F = F_1} is the CDF of non-central t distribution with degree of freedom defined by df and non-centrality defined by delta.

"chisq-chisq": \eqn{F_0} is the CDF of Chisquare distribution with degree of freedom defined by df and \eqn{F = F_1} is the CDF of non-central Chisquare distribution with degree of freedom defined by df and non-centrality defined by delta.

"exp-chisq": \eqn{F_0} is the CDF of exponential distribution with parameter defined by df and \eqn{F = F_1} is the CDF of non-central Chisqaure distribution with degree of freedom defined by df and non-centrality defined by delta.
